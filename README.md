# Trilogy
Hello whoever is reading this! <br></br>
'Trilogy' is a chrome extension that makes copying URLs easier! You may ask, aren't copying URLs easy enough? The inspiration for this project was when one my coding instructors, from an amazing coding program called All Star Code, struggled to copy a link to send to the class. (If you are in highschool I highly recommend you check the program out https://www.allstarcode.org/)
Once this problem occured, my mind immediately came to a solution. This was my first coding project and the first version created was with a team of four in my All Star Code Cohort. We were able to publish the extension in the Chrome store the day before Demo Day and the feeling of having something I worked on published and available for everyone on the internet had me hooked.

First version of Trilogy
<br></br>
After a year and a half of completing All Star Code and improving on the skills I learned through the program, I decided to begin working on Trilogy once again. My main goal was to include a dark mode as this was popular at the time. I looked up an article which helped me with accomplishing this task.
It required me to learn about CSS root variables and then implement an if statement on whether the extension was in dark or light mode and switching them when the user clicks the switch (very simplistic explanation).
<br></br>
Once again, a year after that, I began exploring how I could improve Trilogy further. After showing Trilogy to my friends, they shared to me that the design was now very outdated, which I agreed on as it was very basic and boxy. This led to me wireframing a new version on Adobe XD which you can see below:

Earlier this year I finally completed the redesign using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I was planning to use React.js to redo the design however I eventually decided to make the website for this extension in React.js so look out for that! I am happy with the result as the new design is much more clean and still minimalistic.
The color scheme is still a bit iffy but I enjoy it. Hope you enjoyed reading my Trilogy Journey! I will update if an update idea arises.
